Write a PHP function to test whether a number is greater than 30, 20 or 10 using ternary operator.

Your code:

- should contain PHP **function** with solution. Use type hinting and return type declaration with strict mode enabled;

- should contain PHPUnit test. Test should complete successfully;

- should have no warnings or errors.

You have to deliver the solution files to your Git repository as pull request. Do not merge your code 
to master/main branch without mentor's permission. 

Ask your mentor if you have any questions.
